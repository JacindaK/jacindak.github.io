    <div>
        <p>Hello! I'm Jacinda, known as Litten and Upsetty Spaghetti online, and I am 18 years old as a senior at Craig High 
        School. I work every other weekend as a checker/cashier at Woodman's and volunteer for the Humane Society at PetCo 
        to play with and help take care of adoptable cats there. In my free time, I enjoy playing various games, like Minecraft 
        and Phasmophobia, but typically play Valorant the most. I enjoy playing these games with my friends I know in person, 
        my boyfriend, and even some friends I've met online through these games. While I am a gamer, I also am very passionate 
        about art. I took up a paid internship for graphic design this summer and love drawing when I can. I plan to go to 
        Whitewater to major in graphic design as a future career. In the meantime, I continue to build up my portfolio via my 
        public art account on Instagram and attempt to get myself out there by streaming on twitch.</p>

        <h3>My Cats</h3>
        <p>These are my three cats, Zanie is the dilute calico at the bottom, Trouble is the bicolor cat in the middle, and Meeka is the calico in the back. We got Trouble and Meeka together since they are biological siblings and later got Zanie around Christmas time because of her story. She was found abandoned and pregnant in a barn. All her children were adopted, but she was left alone at Pet Smart. I love them with all my heart!</p>
