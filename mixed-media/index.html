            <p>This is a photo of my final painting for Mr. Pechnik's advanced painting class last year before he left.
            It is made up of thirteen different mediums and was made up of several pieces of scrap canvas. These pieces were put
            together with hot glue, staples, and safety pins. I really enjoy art and painting is just very fun to me and it's 
            easy to rework and correct errors made.</p></td>

            <p>This is just a random, funny video of me just having fun with being a gremlin fighting my boyfriend. We
            mess around a lot just to be funny. We love each other very much and I'm thankful he puts up with my hyper, chaotic
            energy.</p></td>

            <p>This is an image from pre-Milton Homecoming with my younger sibling and two of my friends who go to Milton
            high school. We got the party sushi boat from Fuji, since we all really like sushi. This was a really fun experience
            and I really enjoyed this Homecoming night.</p></td>

            <p>This is a clip I took while playing on a Minecraft server with my boyfriend and a few friends, however, these 
            friends are not featured in this clip. I always collect cats in every Minecraft world and enjoy giving them dumb names,
            as presented in the clip.</p></td>

            <p>This is an image of me with my acoustic guitar. I have been learning and playing guitar for about four years
            now and have been playing an electric guitar for about two. I prefer the electric because of how much louder and more fun 
            it is compared to the acoustic. I play a specially designed electric, as it is both a Stratocaster and Telecaster.
            There is a nob you can pull out that changes its sound to a Tele while it is defaultly a Strat.</p></td>

            <p>This is a clip I took of a casual ace I got in Valorant. I play Valorant a lot in my free time, I would even
            go as far as to say it's my favorite game. I enjoy playing with my friends and boyfriend constantly and am still 
            trying to find my perfect agent, as I fill a lot.</p></td>

            <p>This is a glass painting I did over printed manga pages of my favorite anime, Blue Exorcist. I watch anime
            a lot, as it is a major pass time. I have seen several animes, and some other favorites include Demon Slayer, The
            Devil is a Part-Timer, and Angels of Death.</p></td>
