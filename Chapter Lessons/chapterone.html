    <h1>I like to go swimming in the summer</h1>

    <div>
        <p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>There are three reasons I like to swim:</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>I gets lost of exercise</li>
            <li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
            <li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
